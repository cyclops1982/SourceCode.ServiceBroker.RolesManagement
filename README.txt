PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE BROKER ANYMORE. USE THE K2NE Service Broker at https://github.com/K2NE/K2NEServiceBroker


THIS broker is currently re-worked to work on 4.7 and is NOT TESTED at all.


This ServiceBroker aims to manage the roles within K2.
The primary aim is to create an SMO of the Service Objects that can then be updated via SmartForms, giving the ability to do role management via SmartForms.
